 Bike Share Data Analysis

 Overview

In this project, you will utilize Python to explore and analyze data related to bike share systems in three major cities in the United Statesâ€”Chicago, New York City, and Washington. Your task involves importing the data, computing descriptive statistics, and creating an interactive terminal experience using Python to present these statistics.

Software Requirements

To complete this project, make sure you have the following software installed:

- Python 3
- NumPy
- pandas (installed using Anaconda)
- Text editor (e.g., Sublime or Atom)
- Terminal application (Terminal on Mac and Linux, or Cygwin on Windows)

 Project Details

 Bike Share Data

Bicycle-sharing systems have gained popularity globally over the past decade. These systems enable users to rent bicycles for short-term use, providing flexibility for commuting and leisure. In this project, data provided by Motivate, a bike share system provider, will be used to explore bike share usage patterns in Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC.

Datasets

Randomly selected data for the first six months of 2017 are provided for all three cities. The data files include the following core columns:

- Start Time
- End Time
- Trip Duration (in seconds)
- Start Station
- End Station
- User Type (Subscriber or Customer)

Additionally, Chicago and New York City files include two extra columns: Gender and Birth Year. The original files, though larger and messier, can be accessed [here](Chicago(opens in a new tab), New York City(opens in a new tab), Washington(opens in a new tab)).

Statistics Computed

You will compute various descriptive statistics to understand bike share usage, including:

1. **Popular times of travel:**
   - Most common month
   - Most common day of the week
   - Most common hour of the day

2. **Popular stations and trips:**
   - Most common start station
   - Most common end station
   - Most common trip from start to end

3. **Trip duration:**
   - Total travel time
   - Average travel time

4. **User info:**
   - Counts of each user type
   - Counts of each gender (only available for NYC and Chicago)
   - Earliest, most recent, and most common year of birth (only available for NYC and Chicago)

## Files

To conduct this analysis, you will write a Python script in the `bikeshare.py` file provided. You will also need the following dataset files:

- `chicago.csv`
- `new_york_city.csv`
- `washington.csv`

Download these files from the "all_project_files" document in the Resources tab or access them in the Project Workspace.
